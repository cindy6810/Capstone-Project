Firebase: Firebase Authentication secures user access in Tunely by providing a 
scalable, backend-managed authentication system that supports email/password and 
OAuth logins. It uses JWT-based authentication to ensure secure session management, 
integrating seamlessly with Firebase Realtime Database to store user profiles and 
preferences. This eliminates the need for a custom auth server, ensuring fast, 
reliable, and secure user authentication for a smooth music streaming experience.

React: We use React for Tunely because it provides a fast, modular, and 
scalable UI framework, allowing us to build a dynamic and responsive music streaming 
experience. Its component-based architecture ensures reusability, making features 
like playlists, song lists, and user profiles efficient to develop and maintain.
Additionally, Reactâ€™s virtual DOM optimizes rendering performance, ensuring smooth 
UI interactions even with frequent state updates.
